header[] = Handling Orphaned and Deeply Nested Comments
preface[] = "You can choose how deeply into nested replies Greg's Threaded Comment Numbering plugin should display hierarchical numbering, up to the full 10 levels supported by WordPress. For example, hierarchical numbering up through a depth of 2 will display a number for comment 5 and its replies numbered 5.1, 5.2, etc). With more deeply nested replies, hierarchical numbering can become cumbersome (e.g., comment number 12.19.6.4), so if you choose to stop hierarchical numbering sooner than the level at which you permit comments, you can choose what to display in lieu of a number."

You can choose what to display when this happens. When threading is disabled completely in the WordPress discussion settings, all comments will be correctly ordered, regardless of the setting specified for orphaned replies.

header[] = Perform a Jumble Count
preface[] = "If you're not big on hierarchical numbering, but you'd still like to see a number indicating the order in which comments were received, you can enable the 'jumble count' mode. In this mode, all comments will be numbered strictly in the order in which they were posted. Note that if comments are threaded, the order of posting does not equal the order in which they are displayed. Thus the term 'jumble count': with threaded comments enabled, jumble count may yield a sequence of numbers which does not at all match the order in which the comments are displayed on the page. Note that jumble counting is the most computationally intensive method of numbering: with jumble count enabled, every comment requires a database query to compute its number, whereas with the normal method, just one database query is required per page."
